CoreFunctional
==============

Lightweight Objective-C Functional Programming.

CoreFunctional is a set of polymorphic C functions for doing Type-Safe Function Programming with the
container classes in CoreFoundation. A secondary objective is to remain simple and semantic,
with minimal compiler magic. CoreFunctional is accomplished using the `overloadable` clang
function attribute.
